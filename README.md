## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Understand and query SQL database structures
* Perform advanced SQL operations: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregations
* Optimize SQL queries for performance
* Visualize insights using Python and Power BI
* Explore geospatial patterns in delivery coverage
* Build data storytelling and presentation skills

---

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

* Answer key business questions such as:

  * Price distribution of menu items
  * Distribution of restaurants per location
  * Top 10 pizza restaurants by rating
  * Map locations offering specific dishes (e.g., kapsalon) and their average price
  * Restaurants with best price-to-rating ratio
  * Delivery dead zones
  * Availability of vegetarian and vegan options by area
  * Top hummus-serving restaurants (World Hummus Order)
  * At least 2 original analysis questions

* Optional analyses to enhance insights:

  * Compare cuisines' average ratings across platforms
  * Map high-density restaurant zones
  * Identify cuisine trends in different regions
  * Visualize overlap of restaurant categories on different platforms
  * Compare delivery fees and ratings across platforms

## 🔍 Methodology

1️⃣ **SQL Analysis**

* Write clear and optimized queries
* Extract and aggregate key metrics
* Filter unreliable data (e.g., low number of ratings)
* Generate calculated fields (e.g., price-to-rating ratio, weighted rating)

2️⃣ **Python Visualizations**

* Import SQL query results into pandas
* Generate charts and maps:

  * Scatter plots for restaurant locations
  * Horizontal bar charts for ranking metrics
  * Map plots for delivery zones
* Adjust visuals for clarity, readability, and storytelling

3️⃣ **Power BI Dashboards**

* Import cleaned datasets
* Build interactive dashboards
* Highlight key insights with clear visual storytelling
